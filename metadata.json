    "Description": "The model uses ord2vec, a natural language processing technique to represent SMILES strings. The model was trained on over <4000 small molecules with associated experimental HBV inhibition data (IC50) to classify compounds as HBV inhibitors (IC50 <= 1 uM) or non-inhibitors. Data was gathered from the public repository ChEMBL.",
